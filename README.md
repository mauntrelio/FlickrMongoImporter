# FlickrMongoImporter

A python script to import Flickr metadata to MongoDB and download all pictures. 
To be improved, and with some limitation, but it worked for me.

Sooner or later I will use the Mongo DB with Flcikr imported metadata to generate a photogallery in [Pyppero](https://github.com/mauntrelio/Pyppero), possibly implementing a smart Python controller to resize and cache images like [SLIR](https://github.com/lencioni/SLIR) does.
